# üïµÔ∏è Secrets.mjs

Effortlessly manage your team's local dev environment secrets with gcloud securely.

## Why?

When you are working in a team of developers often times you are running services locally and you need to share and manage secrets with your team.

Google cloud storage is a great tool for this:

üîí **Access control**: You can store secrets securely in a private bucket and share the access to that bucket with all your team members.

üìö **Version control**: You can enable versioning in the gcloud bucket which would help you to keep track of changes to your secrets.

‚ú® **Passwordless authentication**: Gcloud cli uses you gcloud account to authenticate with the cloud storage bucket. This means you can acces, modify and share secrets without having to worry about passwords.

**Secrets.mjs** is a cli which uses the pre installed gcloud sdk to provide an easier interface to manage your secrets. With it you can:

üì• **Download** secrets from the shared cloud storage bucket.

‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Upload** and make changes to the shared cloud storage bucket.

üëÄ **View diffs** between the local version and the cloud storage version of the secrets.

## Pre requisites

- Gcloud SDK: Make sure you have gcloud sdk/cli installed and authenticated.
- Google Cloud Storage Bucket: Access to a google cloud storage bucket where you want to store your team's secrets.

## Installation

You can use secrets.mjs by just copying it and commiting it in your repo.

const LOCAL_SECRETS_DIR = "./secrets";
```
